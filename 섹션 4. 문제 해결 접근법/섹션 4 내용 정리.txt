#문제 해결법

### What is an algorithm?
: A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task. / It's the foundation for being a successful problem solving and developer.

### How do I improve
1. Devise a plan for solving problems
2. Master common problem solving patterns

#Problem
1. Understand the Problem
- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- What are the outputs that should come from ther solution to the problem?
- Can ther outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?(You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.) 
- How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

2. Explore Concrete Examples
- Start with Simple Examples
- Progress to More Complex Examples
- Explore Examples with Empty Inputs
- Explore Examples with Invalid Inputs

3. Break It down
- Explicitly write out the steps you need to take

4. Solve/ Simplify
- Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do 
- Temporarily ignore that difficulty
- Write a simplified solution
- Then incorporate that difficulty back in

5. Look Back and Refactor
